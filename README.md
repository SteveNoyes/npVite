### What I learned

This has to be the thing I am most proud of. I know it's super simple but it got me thinking in different ways. I started thinking of things the computer could  do for me, like updating the date automatically. 

```html
<p class="text-center text-light">copyright &copy; <span class="dateUpdate"></span><script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script> stevenNoyes All Lorem Reserved</p>
```
```css
.example {
  anything: something;
}
```
```js
document.write(new Date().getFullYear())
```
