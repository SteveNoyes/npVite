        <h2 class="blog-post-title pb-5 mb-1 text-center">What Happened In Vegas</h2>
        <p>I walked into the Miracle Mile Shops near Cabo Wabo on the Vegas strip. The first bar on your right is called The Tipsy Robot. Not a single employee in the whole place. I sat down, ordered a drink on a touch screen and watched two mechanical arms swing around and do my job accurately and repeatably. It hit me that once a bartender is the cost of hardware/software and electricity no one is going to make nearly as much as we were.</p>
        <p>Making drinks can be a very fulfilling occupation. Knowing what someone wants when they say "make me something good" can be an art. And learning how to talk with a large swath of society on a daily basis can be just as addicting as making a pisco sour.</p>
        <p>I used to be a bartender.</p>
        <p>For 10 years I worked behind a bar. The last 5 in Las Vegas. I thought I had made it to the top. There were some bartenders that made $100,000 a year on the strip. Not me, I made a little over half that and realized it was a meaningless haul to go much higher. The trade-off between money and social subservience had shifted for me.</p>
        <p>It was during my tenth year bartending. I had come from a small town in New Hampshire, making half of minimum wage plus tips, 2.17 an hour. Vegas was at least 9 an hour to start. There is a bartenders' union and jobs on the strip have 401ks and dental. Things I'd never seen before.</p>
        <p>I was bartending at a small Italian bar north of the old strip. No one was under 60 but me. I served classic cocktails to a crowd that had been there since the early sixties. I thought I went to Vegas to make six-figures and work at a crazy night club on the strip. But then I landed this gig.</p>
        <p>I bought a BMW 328i, earned open water certification in Scuba diving and was able to travel. It was great. I was finally away from the small town bartending that I had grown to hate. In New Hampshire I would want to relax after a shift and go to a small pub across town. I would see people that I had waited on and feel obligated to be my bartender personality instead of my normal personality. They would want to continue like we were still in the same setting. That never happened in Vegas. It was relaxing anonymity.</p>
        <p>I made drinks, yes, but most people go to the bar for social interaction. I work in conversation as much as I do libation. That is the problem I have with cooks that act like they are the heart of the restaurant. If everything runs smoothly no customer ever sees the back of house. They don't have to interact with the general public. I have seen restaurants with amazing food crumble because of terrible wait staff. And I've seen the most amazing waitstaff sell absolute trash and make good money. I worked at both. I can hear the hate before I even finish this. The front of house and back of house have been fighting forever. Anyway, chef. Just leave your food out somewhere and I'm sure there will be a critic to eat it and say something. Short of that, you need the front of house. Cause sure as shit no hungover, knife crazy artist is going to serve food on a daily basis. Nor should they.</p>
        <p>That was a bit of a tangent. What I was trying to say was I was having fun bartending. I liked the money and the city life. I had been at the Italian bar for about three years. One night the guy that sold me my car came in and hung out at the bar. He was a regular. He stayed all night and then out of nowhere he was out the door and he hadn't paid his check. I had the doorman ask him to come back inside and pay. He told the doorman to tell me to go fuck myself.</p>
        <p>I have been treated in ever way possible by every type of person over my 20 years waiting tables and bartending. I finally realized that this was the job. To smile and nod while people treat you like they are always right. There is no HR in most restaurants. I never understood the "what happens in vegas" slogan until I saw a woman, who is probably the sweetest person 9-to-5, throw glasses and bottles at a pregnant bartender for not getting ketchup fast enough. I realized even if I did everything perfect for the next 20 years in restaurants, there would still be someone at the other end of it telling me to go fuck myself. I'd known that guy for three years.</p>
        <p>I knew that didn't happen at other jobs. At least not to the same rampant degree. I felt like Office Space "anyone ever tell you, you're having a serious case of 'the mondays'?"</p>
        <p>I am a bartender dreaming of a desk job.</p>
