        <h2 class="blog-post-title pb-5 mb-1 text-center">Old JavaScript</h2>
        <p>I live in a small town in the middle of Florida. Recently I had four hours to kill while my car was being worked on, so I went to the public library. I went to the computer section, which was all of 10 books, and found the only book on JavaScript. It was from 2001.</p>
        <p>It was great to read about how much harder programming was twenty one years ago. It made a point to say that, since you should write your js as a script tag in the head of your html that, you need to use html comments. Some older browsers don't recognize js so they would just dump out the js code onto the client's screen so this hack would at least comment out the code as a fail safe.</p>
        <p>CSS was part of the advanced features at the end of the book.</p>
        <p>HTML tables were considered a decent design structure.</p>
        <p>I was elated. It reminded me of a parable about a man who was too busy. He went to a physician and said his life was too much, he needed help. The physician said, you are a farmer, you have dogs? Yes. Bring them inside your house and come see me in a week.</p>
        <p>Next week, even worse. He comes in even more upset and unable to focus. The physician listens to the man's problems and askes if he has sheep this year. The man says yes. The physician told the man to bring the sheep into the house and back yard and see him next week.</p>
        <p>Next week, worse. The physician listened to the man rant again and said his problems were even worse. He asked the man if his in-laws still lived in town. The man said yes. The physician said to move them into the house. Not even a week had past and the man came storming into the physician's house saying that he just couldn't take it. Everything the physician had told him made things worse.</p>
        <p>The physician listened until the man was out of breathe and at a loss of what to do. The physician told the man to go home, let the sheep back out to pasture, put the dogs back in the barn. Have the in-laws move back to their house. The man came back the following evening with such a light step. He told the physician that he had solved all his problems. There was so much space in his house and so much time to do everything.</p>
        <p>I'm happy to go back to my 2022 JavaScript problems. </p>
