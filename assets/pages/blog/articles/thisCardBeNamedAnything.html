        <h2 class="blog-post-title pb-5 mb-1 text-center">This {part of the code} Can Be Named Anything</h2>
        <p>Over the course of my learning, this concept has been the hardest for me to grasp. Like learning a new language, the open ended parts of a spoken language are very hard to grasp.</p>
        <p>While working through tutorials it was very hard to understand what part was the working code that could not be changed, that could not be named something else. And what part was the code that I added in.</p>
        <p>For someone coming to this field as a homeschooled, bartender for over a decade. I needed baby steps. I got it by combining a lot of different things. It still took time. Like years to be honest. I didn't have any idea about tech. Until I was 26 I didn't even have a smart phone. I had a single speed bicycle and a typewriter.</p>
        <p>I am glad I went through tutorial hell. I spent countless hours taking freeCodeCampâ€™s JavaScript intro section of 113 units over and over again. mindlessly re-entering the same variables and simple arrays and for loops. Watching, re-watching and falling asleep to cs50 for years. Hearing the same concepts being taught to a new set of students by the same teacher. It was amazing.</p>
        <p>I had kindle unlimited so I would take my kindle into work and read the free, cheap-as-shit, pay-someone-else-to-write kind of churn-mill books that are free en-mas. There were a ton on programming. It gave an overview. As Ken Wilber said 'an orienting generalization'. Once someone spelled out the things that are common in all programming languages I was able to understand the specifics of the language I was learning.</p>
        <p>So I watched cs50 over and over and every year. I read so many books and worked through Treehouse, freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project and Front End Mentor. Just coming to terms with memorizing esoteric concepts that have no perceivable connection to my current life. Solidifying them as new anchors to build larger concepts on.</p>
